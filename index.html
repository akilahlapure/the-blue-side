            In the deep blue ocean, there was a whale that had a hauntingly beautiful voice. She loved to sing, 
            and would often sing for hours on end, making use of her voice to create beautiful melodies and music. 
            However, no matter how beautiful or how loud, nobody in the ocean ever heard her sing. You see, the whale's 
            frequency was different from that of the other animals.

            For years, the whale sang her heart out to the empty sea, she drifted in the hopes of finding a friend, 
            a companion that could hear her voice in the deep waters. She would swim from place to place, but no matter 
            where she went, her songs fell upon deaf ears. She would call out to other animals, but they could never hear it, 
            nodding politely as they swam away.

            The whale knew that she was different from the others, but didn't understand why. She didn't know that the other 
            animals couldn't hear her voice because of her different frequency. All the whale knew was that she was alone and 
            unheard in the vast expanse of the ocean.

            One day, a young boy was on a boat, tossing rocks into the ocean when he heard a faint sound. He looked over the edge 
            of the boat and saw a figure deep beneath the surface. It was the whale, singing its heart out. The whale's voice was 
            soft and melodious, and the child felt that he had to follow it. The boy listened intently, marveling at the beauty of 
            the whale's song. As he’s listening, he tried to match her song by humming the tunes. This caught the whale’s ear and 
            so she swam closer to the surface where the voice is. The young boy reached out and started talking to the whale. At 
            first, she was hesitant because she thought that humans could be dangerous. But this child was different. She sees the 
            child look at her with his big doe eyes filled with wonder and she knew that he meant no harm. They started talking and 
            soon enough, they formed an instant connection, a bond that echoed through the waves.

            From that day on, the young boy and the whale became the most unlikely of friends. As time passed, the child kept coming 
            back to visit the whale and with each visit, their friendship grew stronger as they learn more about each other. The child 
            would always come back with a smile on his face and bring stories to tell about his world, and the whale would sing songs 
            of the ocean, sharing stories of the creatures she had encountered in the depths. As they talked, something stirred within 
            the whale, something she hadn’t felt before. For the first time in her life, she didn’t feel so alone.

            Over time, their friendship grew and deepened. The young boy would bring the whale treats, like seaweed and small fish, and 
            the whale would let out sprays of water to play with the child. And with each passing day, the whale felt more and more 
            connected to this wonderful child who had shown her such kindness.

        <section>
            And so, even though the whale couldn’t be heard by others, she now knows that she is not alone. Even if it was just one person, 
            she was grateful that someone reached out and listened to her story.
