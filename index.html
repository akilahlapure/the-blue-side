            <p>In the deep blue ocean, there was a whale that had a hauntingly beautiful voice. She loved to sing,
                and would often sing for hours on end, making use of her voice to create beautiful melodies and music.
                However, no matter how beautiful or how loud, nobody in the ocean ever heard her sing. You see, the
                whale's
                frequency was different from that of the other animals.</p>

            <p>For years, the whale sang her heart out to the empty sea, she drifted in the hopes of finding a friend,
                a companion that could hear her voice in the deep waters. She would swim from place to place, but no
                matter
                where she went, her songs fell upon deaf ears. She would call out to other animals, but they could never
                hear it,
                nodding politely as they swam away.</p>

            <p>The whale knew that she was different from the others, but didn't understand why. She didn't know that
                the
                other
                animals couldn't hear her voice because of her different frequency. All the whale knew was that she was

            <p>One day, a young boy was on a boat, tossing rocks into the ocean when he heard a faint sound. He looked
                over
                the edge
                of the boat and saw a figure deep beneath the surface. It was the whale, singing its heart out. The
                whale's
                voice was
                soft and melodious, and the child felt that he had to follow it. The boy listened intently, marveling at
                the
                beauty of
                the whale's song. As he’s listening, he tried to match her song by humming the tunes. This caught the
                whale’s ear and
                so she swam closer to the surface where the voice is. The young boy reached out and started talking to
                the
                whale. At
                first, she was hesitant because she thought that humans could be dangerous. But this child was
                different.
                She sees the
                child look at her with his big doe eyes filled with wonder and she knew that he meant no harm. They
                started
                talking and
                soon enough, they formed an instant connection, a bond that echoed through the waves.</p>

        <section id="s5" class="section">
            <p>From that day on, the young boy and the whale became the most unlikely of friends. As time passed, the
                child
                kept coming
                back to visit the whale and with each visit, their friendship grew stronger as they learn more about
                each
                other. The child
                would always come back with a smile on his face and bring stories to tell about his world, and the whale
                would sing songs
                of the ocean, sharing stories of the creatures she had encountered in the depths. As they talked,
                something
                stirred within
                the whale, something she hadn’t felt before. For the first time in her life, she didn’t feel so alone.

            <p>Over time, their friendship grew and deepened. The young boy would bring the whale treats, like seaweed
                and
                small fish, and
                the whale would let out sprays of water to play with the child. And with each passing day, the whale
                felt
                more and more
                connected to this wonderful child who had shown her such kindness.</p>
